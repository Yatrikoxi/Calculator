# Calculator

Last project at the end of Foundations. HTML / CSS / JS

This project was mainly focused on practising and showing your skills newly acquired in the Foundations part of Curicullum.
Combining HTML/CSS/JS - dom manipulation, creating functions and debugging.

After last project - Etch a Sketch, this was less hard than I expected. But it still took quite a lot of time.

For CSS I mainly tried to stick to flexbox and Grid arranging.

At first I made basic css layout and added button event listeners. After that basic functions and math equations.
Next was to make sure calculator doesn't show decimals long as LOTR books. After that, Keyboard input and I was done.

Hope you like this small calculator that is final project of Foundations program in the Odin Project.
