# Calculator

Last project at the end of Fundamentals. HTML / CSS / JS

This project was mainly focused on practising and showing your skills newly acquired in the Fundamentals par of Curicullum.
Combining HTML/CSS/JS - dom manipulation, creating functions and debugging

After last project, this was less hard than I expected. But it still took quite a lot of time.

For CSS I mainly tried to stick to flexbox and Grid arranging.

Hope you like this small calculator that is final project of Fundamentals program in the Odin Project.
